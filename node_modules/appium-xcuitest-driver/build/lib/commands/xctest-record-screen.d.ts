 * The resulting movie is automatically deleted FOR SIMULATORS ONLY.

 * @param remotePath - The path to the remote location, where the resulting video should be
 * uploaded.
 * The following protocols are supported: `http`, `https`, `ftp`. Null or empty
 * string value (the default setting) means the content of resulting file
 * should be encoded as Base64 and passed as the endpoint response value. An
 * exception will be thrown if the generated media file is too big to fit into
 * the available process memory.
 * @param user - The name of the user for the remote authentication.
 * Only works if `remotePath` is provided.
 * @param pass - The password for the remote authentication.
 * Only works if `remotePath` is provided.
 * @param headers - Additional headers mapping for multipart http(s) uploads
 * @param fileFieldName - The name of the form field where the file content BLOB should be stored for
 * http(s) uploads
 * @param formFields - Additional form fields for multipart http(s) uploads
 * @param method - The http multipart upload method name.
 * Only works if `remotePath` is provided.
 * @returns The resulting movie with base64-encoded content or empty string if uploaded remotely.
 * @throws {Error} If there was an error while retrieving the video
 * file or the file content cannot be uploaded to the remote location.
